          Whatever happens, happens for good.... I started Freelancing 2 years
          ago and started on Fiverr as a newbie.

        <div class="para" id="left" data-aos="fade-up-right">
          few months forward, I got some clients and was growing in the platform
          until my account got completely banned as I didnt know the rules that
          you cant bring clients off the platform and was reluctant about the
          warnings as a newbie and didnt give that part much attention so this
          happened.

        <div class="para" id="right" data-aos="fade-up-left">
          I still remember that day on December 2020, I opened Fiverr as was not
          able to access my seller account, my heart skipped a beat at that
          moment and I felt devastated, I tried to contact their service center
          but their reply was not convincing and ultimately I lost my account
          and my income was stopped completely.

        <div class="para" id="left" data-aos="zoom-in-left">
          I was awful and despaired. After few days and after getting my tears
          up, I decided that "NO MATTER WHATS I AM GONNA MAKE IT AND WILL BE A
          SUCCESSFUL FREELANCER SOME DAY"
        </div>

        <div class="para" id="right" data-aos="fade-up-left">
          From that day I worked day and night, cut my slept to 4 hours per day
          and just tried super hard to get this time through.

          Sometimes it felt like I was converting my blood to sweat but I can
          gladly say that all paid off, after 2-3 weeks of networking, cold
          emailing and searching for freelancing opportunities, I got
          connecction with some few production hpuse, youtube channels and more
          coonections through which I got help to restart my carrier in
          freelancing.
